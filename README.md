# Data Science example projects

This repository have some data science projects in order to practice and polish my skills. I hope it could be useful for someone (and me) somehow ðŸ˜ƒ

## Predictive Modeling

_Dataset:_ [Customer Purchasing Behaviors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hanaksoy/customer-purchasing-behaviors)

_Task:_ Build a predictive model using a provided dataset to forecast customer churn. Explain the steps, feature selection, and model performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall).

_Skills:_ Python/R, Machine Learning (logistic regression, decision trees), data cleaning, feature engineering.


## Time Series Analysis

_Dataset:_ []()

_Task:_ Use a time series dataset (e.g., sales data) to predict future trends. Perform data preprocessing and apply models like ARIMA or Facebook Prophet.

_Skills:_ Time series analysis, statistical models, Python (statsmodels), visualization.


## Classification Problem

_Dataset:_ []()

_Task:_ Classify a set of medical records into high-risk and low-risk categories for a certain disease using machine learning. Justify your choice of algorithm and explain the results.

_Skills:_ Python/R, scikit-learn, random forest/SVM/Logistic Regression, cross-validation.


## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

_Dataset:_ []()

_Task:_ Analyze customer reviews using sentiment analysis to classify them as positive or negative. Optionally, extract key topics from the text.

_Skills:_ Python (NLTK, spaCy), text preprocessing, vectorization (TF-IDF), sentiment analysis, clustering.

## A/B Testing

_Dataset:_ []()

_Task:_ Design and analyze the results of an A/B test to determine whether a new product feature increases user engagement. Perform hypothesis testing and interpret the results.

_Skills:_ Python, statistical hypothesis testing, t-tests, metrics analysis.

## Data Mining on Big Data

_Dataset:_ []()

_Task:_ Perform data mining on a large-scale dataset (e.g., web logs) using distributed processing (e.g., Spark or Hadoop) to identify anomalies or trends.

_Skills:_ Python, big data tools (Hadoop, Spark), data mining algorithms, parallel computing.


## Recommendation System

_Dataset:_ []()

_Task:_ Build a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system for a dataset of customer purchases or product ratings. Discuss model evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and RMSE.

_Skills:_ Python/R, matrix factorization, collaborative filtering, recommender systems.
Data Pipeline Automation:

_Task:_ Create an automated data pipeline that processes raw customer data, applies transformations, and outputs aggregated insights. Focus on modular code design.

_Skills:_ Python, data pipeline tools (Airflow, Luigi), ETL processes, modular programming.


## Clustering Analysis

_Dataset:_ []()

_Task:_ Perform customer segmentation on a dataset using clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN. Explain how you determined the number of clusters.

_Skills:_ Python/R, clustering techniques, elbow method, silhouette score.


## Survival Analysis

_Dataset:_ []()

_Task:_ Use survival analysis techniques to model the time until a customer churns or until a patient relapses. Discuss the model assumptions and performance.

_Skills:_ Python (lifelines library), survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier estimators, Cox proportional hazards model.
